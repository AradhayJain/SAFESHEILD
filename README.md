# 🛡️ SafeShield – Behavioral Authentication System

SafeShield is a next-generation **behavioral authentication system** designed to **secure mobile banking platforms** using real-time analysis of user behavior. It provides **continuous, non-intrusive identity verification** based on how users type and swipe — effectively detecting session hijacking and credential misuse **after login**.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional authentication methods — passwords, OTPs, and even biometrics — are susceptible to post-login attacks such as **session hijacking** or **device compromise**. There’s a lack of **continuous user verification** once a session starts, which puts sensitive financial data at risk.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

SafeShield enhances digital security through **Behavior-Based Authentication (BBA)**, continuously analyzing behavioral signals like typing speed and swipe gestures. It ensures that the person interacting with the app is still the legitimate user — not an impostor.

---

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

### 🔹 1. Behavioral Signal Collection
- **Captured Inputs**: Typing and swipe gestures (speed, direction, pressure)
- **Passive Monitoring**: Non-intrusive, background data collection
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Via encrypted WebSocket connection

### 🔹 2. Adaptive Machine Learning
- **Model**: `IsolationForest` (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- **Training**: On ~15–50 valid user sessions
- **Update Cycle**: Continuous, evolves with new data
- **Storage**: Serialized per-user model using Pickle

### 🔹 3. Feature Engineering
| Signal Type | Features |
|-------------|----------|
| **Typing**  | `hold_mean`, `hold_std`, `flight_mean`, `flight_std`, `backspace_rate`, `typing_speed` |
| **Swipe**   | `speed_mean`, `speed_std`, `direction_mean`, `direction_std`, `acceleration_mean`, `acceleration_std` |

### 🔹 4. Real-Time Risk Scoring
- **Classification**: Normal, Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Latency**: <500ms
- **Response**: Dynamic — session lock, re-auth, or passive monitoring
